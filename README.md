## General info
My task in this project was to create a software to display that will show information such as the car current speed, 
drive tribe, activity of lights and indicators, battery capacity or car range.
Because the display was supposed to be on the steering wheel, the main challenge was the functionality of rotating the displayed speed value 
together with the steering wheel rotation, so that the displayed speed was always vertical.

## Technologies
* Kivy - version 2.0.0
* Python - version 3.9
* Raspberry Pi OS Kernel - version 5.4

## Setup
https://kivy.org/doc/stable/gettingstarted/installation.html

## Code Examples
Will be added.

## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Rotating the displayed speed value.
* Program starts right after system startup.
* No refreh delay.

To-do list:
* Independence from display size.
* Displaying any errors.

## Status
Project is finished for this version of prototype, probably in next version it will be done on STM32, acording to long time to start Raspberry Pi OS and huge power consumptions.
